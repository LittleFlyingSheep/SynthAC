# SynthAC Demo

This is the demo corresponding to the paper "Synth-AC: Enhancing Audio Captioning with Synthetic Supervision".

## Demo of image captions and audio captions

We provide some examples of image captions and audio captions, to show the implicit relation between image captions and acoustic scenes.

| Image Caption                                                | Audio Caption                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| A black car is near someone riding a bike                    | A man talking and a car passing by loudly |
| A barking dog looks over a ledge lined with Christmas lights | Dog barking and growling                  |
| A cat sleeping on a rock near a bike                         | A cat sleeps and snores                   |


## Synthetic data demo

Moreover, there are some examples of the synthetic text-audio pairs provided in [synthetic_data](./synthetic_data/).  

## Some insteresting examples

We also provide some generated examples as below:
- Examples to show that the visual description (e.g., the color "white/black" in "a white/black car") does not affect the content of synthetic audio, at this [path](./examples about 'a white or black car'/).
- Examples of synthetic audio with the prompt "a ledge lined with Christmas lights".
