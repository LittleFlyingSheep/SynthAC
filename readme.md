# SynthAC Demo

This is the demo corresponding to the paper "Synth-AC: Enhancing Audio Captioning with Synthetic Supervision".

## Demo of image captions and audio captions

We provide some examples of image captions and audio captions, to show the implicit relation between image captions and acoustic scenes.

| Image Caption                                                | Audio Caption                             |
