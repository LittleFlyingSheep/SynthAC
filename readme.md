This is the demo corresponding to the work of the paper "Synth-AC: Enhancing Audio Captioning with Synthetic Supervision".

We provide some examples of image captions and audio captions, to show the implicit relation between image captions and acoustic scenes.

Moreover, there are some examples of the synthetic text-audio pairs provided in [synthetic data](./synthetic data).
